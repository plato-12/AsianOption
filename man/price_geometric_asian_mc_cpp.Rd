\arguments{
\item{S0}{Initial stock price (positive)}

\item{K}{Strike price (positive)}

\item{r}{Gross risk-free rate per period (e.g., 1.05 for 5\% rate)}

\item{d}{Base down factor in CRR model (e.g., 0.8)}

\item{lambda}{Price impact coefficient (non-negative)}

\item{v_u}{Hedging volume on up move (non-negative)}

\item{v_d}{Hedging volume on down move (non-negative)}

\item{n}{Number of time steps (positive integer)}

\item{n_simulations}{Number of Monte Carlo paths to simulate (default: 100000)}

\item{option_type}{Type of option: "call" or "put" (default: "call")}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility (default: -1 for no seed)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item price: Estimated option price
  \item std_error: Standard error of the estimate
  \item n_simulations: Number of simulations used
}
}
\description{
Computes the price of a geometric Asian option using Monte Carlo simulation.
This method is more efficient for large n (> 20) compared to exact enumeration.
}
\details{
The Monte Carlo method randomly samples price paths according to the
risk-neutral probability p_adj. For each simulated path:
\itemize{
  \item Generate n Bernoulli(p_adj) random draws for up/down moves
  \item Compute the geometric average of prices along the path
  \item Calculate the payoff: max(0, G - K) for calls or max(0, K - G) for puts
}

The option price is estimated as the mean of discounted payoffs, with
standard error = sd(payoffs) / sqrt(n_simulations).

Monte Carlo is recommended for n > 20 where exact enumeration becomes
computationally prohibitive (2^n paths).
