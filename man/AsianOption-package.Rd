\title{AsianOption: Asian Option Pricing with Price Impact}
\description{
Implements binomial tree pricing for geometric and arithmetic Asian options
incorporating market price impact from hedging activities. Uses the
Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) model with the replicating portfolio method.
}
\section{Main Functions}{

\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{price_geometric_asian}}: Exact pricing for geometric Asian calls
  \item \code{\link{arithmetic_asian_bounds}}: Bounds for arithmetic Asian calls
  \item \code{\link{compute_p_adj}}: Compute adjusted risk-neutral probability
  \item \code{\link{compute_adjusted_factors}}: Compute modified up/down factors
  \item \code{\link{check_no_arbitrage}}: Validate no-arbitrage condition
}
}

\section{Price Impact Mechanism}{

When market makers hedge options, their trading volume causes price movements
following the Kyle (1985) linear impact model. This modifies the binomial tree
dynamics through adjusted up/down factors and risk-neutral probability.
}

\section{Mathematical Framework}{

The package uses the replicating portfolio approach where the option value
equals the cost of constructing a portfolio that replicates its payoff,
leading to risk-neutral pricing.

For geometric Asian options, the geometric average of stock prices is used.
For arithmetic Asian options, rigorous upper and lower bounds are computed
using Jensen's inequality. A tighter path-specific bound is available via
exact path enumeration.
}

\section{No-Arbitrage Condition}{

For valid pricing, the model requires that the adjusted down factor is less
than the risk-free rate, which is less than the adjusted up factor. This
ensures a valid risk-neutral probability. All pricing functions validate
this condition automatically.

For detailed mathematical formulations, see the package vignettes and
the reference paper.
}

\section{Computational Complexity}{

The implementation enumerates all \eqn{2^n} possible price paths:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{n \leq 15}: Fast (< 1 second)
  \item \eqn{n = 20}: ~1 million paths (~10 seconds)
  \item \eqn{n > 20}: Warning issued automatically
}
