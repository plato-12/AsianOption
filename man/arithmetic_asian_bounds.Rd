\description{
Computes lower and upper bounds for the arithmetic Asian option (call or put)
using the relationship between arithmetic and geometric means (Jensen's
inequality).
}
\details{
Computes rigorous upper and lower bounds for arithmetic Asian options using
Jensen's inequality. The lower bound is the geometric Asian option price
(from AM-GM inequality). Two types of upper bounds are available:

\strong{Global upper bound:} Uses a worst-case spread parameter applicable
to all paths.

\strong{Path-specific upper bound:} Computes tighter bounds by using
path-specific spread parameters. This requires exact enumeration of all 2^n
paths in the binomial tree (no sampling or approximation). The path-specific
bound is typically much tighter than the global bound.

For detailed mathematical formulations, see the package vignettes and the
reference paper.
