Description: Implements binomial tree pricing for geometric and arithmetic
    Asian options incorporating market price impact from hedging activities.
    Uses the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein ('CRR') model with the replicating portfolio
    method. Provides exact pricing for geometric Asian options and bounds
    for arithmetic Asian options based on Jensen's inequality. The price
    impact mechanism models how hedging volumes affect stock prices, leading
    to modified risk-neutral probabilities. References: Tiwari, P., & Majumdar, S. (2025). Asian option valuation under price impact. *arXiv preprint*. <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2512.07154>
